        <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-muted-foreground">
          Most college messes and canteens still plan meals manually — fixed quantities, paper registers and
          little visibility into who's actually eating. This leads to food waste, unclear bills and frustrated
          students. FoodPulse gives every stakeholder — student, mess manager and admin — a shared, data-driven
          view of meals, so decisions are based on real demand instead of estimates.
