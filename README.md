# FoodPulse Dashboard

FOODPULSE — COMPLETE FRONTEND-ONLY WEB APPLICATION

Build a complete, polished, responsive frontend-only web application called "FoodPulse", based strictly on the provided FoodPulse Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

FoodPulse is a web-based mess subscription management platform designed for students, mess managers, and administrators. Its purpose is to manage meal subscriptions, meal selection/skipping, billing status, menu management, feedback, food consumption, food wastage estimation, and smart meal-demand analytics.

1. CRITICAL PROJECT CONSTRAINT

This project is FRONTEND ONLY.

DO NOT IMPLEMENT:

Backend

Node.js / Express server

REST APIs

Database

MySQL

PostgreSQL

Supabase database

Firebase backend

Server-side authentication

Real payment gateway

UPI integration

Card integration

Wallet integration

Email server

SMS service

External AI/ML API

Real deployment configuration

Do not create unnecessary backend infrastructure.

INSTEAD:

Use:

React

TypeScript

Modern frontend component architecture

Frontend/local state

Mock JSON/data objects

LocalStorage only where useful for simulating persistence

Reusable components

Responsive layouts

Charts using a suitable frontend charting library

Frontend validation

Mock/demo interactions

The result must be a fully interactive frontend prototype, not a collection of static HTML screens.

Every major button, navigation item, tab, toggle, filter, search field, modal, form, dropdown and action should have an appropriate frontend interaction.

2. PURPOSE OF THIS PROTOTYPE

The final application should look and behave like a real FoodPulse product even though there is no backend or database.

The application should allow us to demonstrate:

Student experience

Mess Manager experience

Admin experience

Subscription management

Meal selection and skipping

Meal history

Payment/billing status

Menu management

Subscriber management

Food consumption entry

Food wastage analytics

7-day meal-demand prediction

Peak demand analysis

Smart recommendations

Feedback and complaint management

Reports

Notifications

Role-based UI

Use realistic mock data throughout the application.

3. APPLICATION BRANDING

Application name:

FoodPulse

Tagline:

Smart Mess Management. Less Waste. Better Meals.

FoodPulse should have a modern SaaS/dashboard appearance suitable for a professional college software project.

Design characteristics:

Clean

Modern

Professional

Minimal

Data-driven

Food/meal-oriented

Easy to navigate

Mobile responsive

Accessible

Consistent spacing

Consistent typography

Consistent cards, tables, buttons and badges

Do not make the interface look like a generic admin template.

Create a recognizable FoodPulse visual identity.

4. USER ROLES

The frontend must support three simulated roles:

STUDENT

Primary end user.

MESS MANAGER

Responsible for daily mess operations, menu, subscribers, payments, meal consumption, wastage and analytics.

ADMIN

Highest-privilege system administrator responsible for users, mess managers, plans, subscriptions, payments, reports, security/audit information and system settings.

5. DEMO LOGIN

Because there is no backend authentication, create a Demo Login System.

Login page should contain:

Email

Password

Login button

Forgot Password

Register

Also provide clearly visible demo account buttons:

Student Demo

Login as Student

Mess Manager Demo

Login as Mess Manager

Admin Demo

Login as Admin

Clicking a demo role should open the corresponding dashboard.

Use frontend state/localStorage to remember the currently selected demo role.

Implement protected frontend routes so that:

Student sees only Student interface

Mess Manager sees only Mess Manager interface

Admin sees only Admin interface

This is a UI simulation only and must not be treated as real security.

Users

At least 15–20 students.

Plans

Weekly and Monthly.

Subscriptions

Active, expired, paused, cancelled.

Meals

At least 30 days of mock Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner data.

Payments

Paid and Unpaid.

Menus

Consumption

Prepared and Consumed quantities.

Analytics

Multiple notification types.

Audit logs

Realistic Admin actions.

Do not use lorem ipsum or obviously fake placeholder content.

53. FRONTEND STATE

Use frontend state to simulate application behavior.

Examples:

Selecting a meal updates its status.

Skipping a meal updates the calendar.

Subscribing to a plan updates subscription state.

Marking payment as Paid updates payment status.

Editing a menu updates menu display.

Changing complaint status updates complaint status.

Updating consumption updates wastage calculations.

Changing plan price updates plan cards.

Notifications become read when clicked.

Use LocalStorage where useful so demo changes survive page refresh during the same browser session.

54. BUSINESS RULES TO SIMULATE

Implement these frontend rules:

Student can have only one active subscription in the UI.

Only active subscribers can select/skip meals.

Locked meals cannot be changed.

Default meal cutoff is 10:00 PM previous day.

Payment status can be changed only from Manager/Admin interfaces.

Only Admin UI can manage users and Mess Managers.

Only Manager/Admin UI can access payment and analytics screens.

Prepared quantity cannot be lower than consumed quantity.

Payment/subscription records should not have permanent delete buttons; use deactivate/void where appropriate.

Confirmation should be required for destructive actions.

Important:

These are frontend demonstrations only, not real security or server-side enforcement.

55. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

The entire application must work on:

Desktop

Laptop

Tablet

Mobile

For mobile:

Collapsible sidebar

Bottom navigation where appropriate

Responsive tables

Horizontally scrollable data tables when necessary

Stacked cards

Mobile-friendly charts

Mobile-friendly forms and modals

Do not simply shrink the desktop interface.

Design proper responsive layouts.

56. REUSABLE COMPONENTS

Create reusable components for:

Sidebar

Topbar

Dashboard cards

Status badges

Buttons

Tables

Search

Filters

Modal

Form fields

Date picker

Calendar

Notification panel

Charts

Empty state

Loading skeleton

Confirmation dialog

Toast notifications

Progress bars

Rating component

Avoid duplicating components unnecessarily.

57. VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

Use appropriate charts for:

Weekly meal demand

Meal popularity

Food wastage

Subscription trends

Payment trends

User growth

Weekday/weekend comparison

Charts should have:

Clear labels

Tooltips

Legends where useful

Responsive sizing

Meaningful mock data

Do not create charts purely for decoration.

58. ACCESSIBILITY AND UX

Implement:

Proper labels

Keyboard-friendly controls

Clear focus states

Accessible buttons

Readable contrast

Helpful validation messages

Confirmation messages

Clear status indicators

Avoid relying only on color to communicate status

59. NAVIGATION

All navigation links must work.

No dead links.

No placeholder "Coming Soon" pages for functionality that is part of the SRS.

Every listed page must be implemented.

Breadcrumbs should be used where helpful on deeper pages.

60. FRONTEND ROUTING

Create proper frontend routes for all major pages.

Suggested structure:

/
 /about
 /how-it-works
 /features
 /help
 /contact

 /login
 /register
 /forgot-password

 /student/*
 /manager/*
 /admin/*


Use route guards based on the simulated demo role.

61. DESIGN QUALITY

The application should feel like a real SaaS product.

Avoid:

Generic template appearance

Excessive gradients

Excessive animations

Huge unnecessary text

Random colors

Inconsistent spacing

Inconsistent buttons

Unstyled tables

Static screenshots pretending to be dashboards

Use subtle animations only where they improve UX.

62. IMPORTANT SRS ALIGNMENT

The frontend must visually represent the following major SRS features:

Authentication

Registration, login, profile and role-based interface.

Subscription

Weekly/Monthly plans, active/expired status, renewal, pause/cancellation request.

Meal Management

Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner selection, skip functionality, calendar, cutoff state, meal history and progress.

Payment

Bills, Paid/Unpaid status, payment history.

Admin/Manager

Plans, users, subscribers, menus, payments, dashboards and reports.

Smart Analytics

7-day rolling-average demand prediction, wastage estimation, peak demand, meal popularity, weekday/weekend comparison and textual smart suggestions.

Feedback

1–5 rating, complaint/suggestion, complaint status and manager response.

These are the core functional areas described in the SRS.

63. DO NOT OVER-IMPLEMENT TBD FEATURES

The SRS marks several features as TBD/future enhancements.

Do NOT implement these as real functionality:

Real UPI/card/wallet payment gateway

Advanced machine-learning demand forecasting

QR-code meal verification

IoT kitchen integration

Native Android/iOS application

AI chatbot

If desired, show them only as clearly labelled Future Enhancements in the public About/Features documentation.

Do not make them part of the working application.

64. FINAL DEMO FLOW

Do not stop after creating only the dashboard.

Implement all public pages, authentication screens, Student pages, Mess Manager pages, Admin pages, analytics pages, reports, forms, tables, modals, charts, navigation, mock data and frontend interactions described above.

The application should be ready to demonstrate as a complete FoodPulse product UI.

Again:

FRONTEND ONLY.
NO BACKEND.
NO DATABASE.
NO API.
NO REAL AUTHENTICATION.
NO REAL PAYMENT GATEWAY.
NO EXTERNAL AI/ML.
